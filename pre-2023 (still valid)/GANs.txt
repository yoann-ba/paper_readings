Goodfellow

Paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661

Introduces Generative Adversarial Networks. Introduces Adversarial Training in General.

Details in Intro and Related Work some of the previous alternatives and their issues. 

Details in Section 6 and 7 Avantages, Disadvantages and future upgrade directions.

Goes hard on the theoretical math in the middle.

# 2020 — Multi Scale Gradient GAN
Paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06048v4.pdf

Adapts GANs to fix some of their main inherent issues through having skip connections in between different levels of scale (4x4, 16x16, …, 1024x1024), similarly to a U-Net.

Long Introduction that reflects on the impact of the first paper, and the trends and patterns where GANs excel or fail.

Mentions a lot of alternative GAN improvements that popped up over the years. Tries adapting some of them to their new idea when applicable.

Thorough analysis of Quality, Training Stability and Robustness to Learning Rate in Section 3.
