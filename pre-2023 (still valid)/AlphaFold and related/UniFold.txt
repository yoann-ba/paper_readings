Uni-Fold: An Open-Source Platform for Developing Protein Folding Models beyond AlphaFold

Paper :  https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502811v3.full
Code :  https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Fold

They reimplemented AlphaFold and AlphaFold-Multimer in the PyTorch framework, and reproduced their from-scratch training processes with equivalent or better accuracy

⇒ Uni-Fold achieves about 2.2 times training acceleration compared with AlphaFold
⇒ Uni-Fold outperforms AlphaFold-Multimer by approximately 2% on the TM-Score

The inconveniences of AlphaFold : 

The current open-source code of AlphaFold does not contain any training scripts or utilities of the model
The code of AlphaFold is based on JAX framework, which is limited to a community currently much smaller than TensorFlow and PyTorch
The original AlphaFold was designed and trained on Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which is hardly accessible to the majority of the research community

⇒ Uni-Fold supports the training and inference of both monomeric and multimeric models with high accuracy and efficiency

Concerning their methods, they upgraded some alphaFold processes like :

For protein homology : 

Genetic search
Cross-chain genetics
Template search

They altered the model and loss functions of the AlphaFold (-Multimer) :

ReLU activation ⇒ Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs)
They added a postprocessing layer to the output of OuterProductMean module in AlphaFold
They enhanced the auxiliary heads by adding an activation function

Acceleration techniques : 

Mixed precision training : partial or whole calculations of the model is conducted in half-precision to save time and memory
Operator fusion : merge multiple consecutive operators into one
Memory-efficient inference : AlphaFold splits the input tensor into multiple small chunks along one dimension and sequentially forwards the chunks
Per-sample gradient clipping displays a significant advantage
They adopted the self-distillation strategy of AlphaFold

Metrics : 

For monomer evaluations : TM score
For multimer evaluations : they adapted single-chain metrics to assemblies

⇒ On both monomer and multimer tasks, Uni-Fold Multimer significantly outperformed AlphaFold-Multimer on RMSD and TM-Score

Uni-Fold v2 contained a reproduction of from-scratch training of AlphaFold (-Multimer too), it supports both training and inference.
