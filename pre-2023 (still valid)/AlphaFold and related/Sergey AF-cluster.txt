Sergey AF-cluster - Prediction of multiple conformational states by combining sequence clustering with AlphaFold2

paper https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.17.512570v1.full#F7

Process : 

Do a normal MSA search on the query sequence
Cluster the MSA lines by sequence distance alignment (by DBSCAN)
Re-build a small cropped MSA for each custer and run one AF inference per cluster
Some of the results that have high confidence are different conformations
