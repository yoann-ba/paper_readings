# 2020 â€” YOLOv4 : Fast, Accurate, One-stage obj detector, CNN
Paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934

One stage object detector, probably makes references to the previous YOLOs (You Only Look Once, for one-stage detector).

Goes into a lot of details about all the different modules, methods and functions that can be added, modified or combined into their architecture.

Makes a ton of references to these methods, and to the rest of object detection as a whole.

Very thorough analyses.

# 2022 - YOLOv7: Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02696
source code - Pytorch (use to reproduce results): https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7

YOLOv7 is more accurate and faster than YOLOv5 by 120% FPS, than YOLOX by 180% FPS, than Dual-Swin-T by 1200% FPS, than ConvNext by 550% FPS, than SWIN-L by 500% FPS, than PPYOLOE-X by 150% FPS.

YOLOv7 surpasses all known object detectors in both speed and accuracy in the range from 5 FPS to 160 FPS and has the highest accuracy 56.8% AP among all known real-time object detectors with 30 FPS or higher on GPU V100, batch=1.

> supposedly insane perf (efficiency) compared to SotA, paper mentions a bunch of methods, tricks, problems that are common today in DL that Idk
